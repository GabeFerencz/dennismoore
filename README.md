"I practice every day. Well, not absolutely every day, but most days 
in the week. I expect I must practice four or five times a week, at least 
four or five, only some weekends. Like last weekend, there really wasn't 
the time, so that moved the average down a bit. " - Dennis Moore

This repo is a collection of small practice problems.

## heapq

A heap sorting data structure written in Python.

## encoding

Bitwise encoding and decoding written in C for Linux. The accompanying
Python code was used for prototyping and lookup table generation.

## dirgrab

A utility written in Python to grab all directories containing a search
string. This was written because the log folders needed for debugging a
product I work on are often buried a few levels deep in a directory 
tree and I can never remember the few different places where the files
reside.
